# Outline 
Topic: I am mapping(visualizing) green roof and green roof potential in NYC, to see:
Research Question: Where in the city are they located? And where can they be implemented?
Significance: This is because green roofs have immense benefits for climate change mitigation and resiliency.
	How will we define green roofs for the study?
o	Based on the data available
o	Probably more conservative estimates (i.e not community gardens, but also not potted plants on a roof top)
	Assumptions need to be made on the kind of plants and space needed to qualify as a green roof (in order to make benefit calculations easier to do)
o	Barot, S., Abbadie, L., Auclerc, A., Barthélémy, C., Bérille, E., Billet, P., . . . Dusza, Y. (2019). Urban ecology, stakeholders and the future of ecology. Science of the Total Environment, 667, 475-484. doi:10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.02.410
	Where are green roofs located?
o	The Nature Conservancy Archive of current green roofs
o	Look at NYC Planning for building records, zip codes, roof footprint
	Where can they be implemented?
o	Again, NYC Planning land use and geographic datasets 
o	Case study: Kubi Ackerman (2012)The Potential for Urban Agriculture in NYC. Urban Design Lab and Earth Institute, Columbia University.
	What are the benefits of green roofs? 
o	Which ones will be included in the project?
	Depends on the audience and stakeholders (interconnected but there are environmental benefits and socio-economic ones include all if feasible)
o	At what level are we measuring benefits?
	Census tract
	Community district
	Sewer shed
	Tax lot
	Building?!
o	The evidence based benefits: 
	Storm water retention: what it means, how will it be measured

•	NYC Department of Environmental Protections
	Surface temperature reduction: how will this be measured, benefits of this reduction
•	Raster data, LANDSAT
	Habitat and biodiversity conservation: 
•	what biodiversity exists in NYC
•	how will this be measured
•	why is it important
•	what are their habitat needs 
	Community green space (emotional and mental benefits): criteria of what to include as "emotional and mental" benefits, how to measure this, what the benefits of this are conceptually and potentially
	Energy consumption reduction--> cost effective: what to include in the cost here, just energy due to heat or also energy due to cooling systems, storm water management, ect..
	Carbon sequestering
	Air pollution control
	How to calculate the benefits?
o	Tabatabaee, S., Mahdiyar, A., Durdyev, S., Mohandes, S. R., & Ismail, S. (2019). An assessment model of benefits, opportunities, costs, and risks of green roof installation: A multi criteria decision making approach. Journal of Cleaner Production, 238 doi:10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.117956
	Who are the stakeholders? 
o	How to design for specific stakeholders with varied interests
o	Stakeholders
	Policy makers
	Urban planners
	Environmental activists/ affordable housing NGOs
	Academic
o	Goals:
	I want to the tool to encourage research and funding for nature-based solutions like green roofs for climate change impacts on cities. 
	I want the tool to encourage policy makers to make nature-based solutions like green roofs easy to implement (and cheap! Tax cuts?!)
	I want homeowners to be persuaded to implement green roofs
o	It has to be easy to read and navigate (academics and policy makers are not artists)
